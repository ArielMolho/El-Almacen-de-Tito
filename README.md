# El Almacen de Tito

This is a project granted through CoderHouse to their TOP 10 students in order to get real experience of things learned through the Web Development course. This involved creating static page using HTML, CSS along with [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.0/getting-started/introduction/) as library.
Design was provided by a fellow UX Designer through [Figma](https://www.figma.com/file/H6buz5wxloAqEFv5oLBA9M/Almac%C3%A9n-de-Tito?node-id=1%3A2)(veiwing premission required).

Being a static page it is basically aimed for users to get an overview of clients product and then contact via social networks.
